      <h2>Why did you do this?</h2>
      <p>We want to encourage bolt12 use. And tipping is a fantastic way to demo it.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Which wallets does it work with?</h2>
      <p>Any wallet that supports Bolt12 (Phoenix, Strike, Wallet of Satoshi).</p>

    <section>
      <h2>How do I send a tip?</h2>
      <p>Paste a worthy tweet (are they still called that?) into the form. Scan the QR code with your lightning wallet. We’ll post a reply under the tweet that it’s been tipped with a link to it.</p>

      <h2>Will you steal my data?</h2>
      <p>We can't: all we know is your X username and your bolt12 address. But we could send you sweet sats.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>My tip didn't arrive…</h2>
      <p>We have a minimum payout of 1000 sats (roughly $1) (we’d like to do less but the payment provider doesn’t support this yet). So we hold your tip until it’s greater than 1000 sats and then trigger a payout.</p>
